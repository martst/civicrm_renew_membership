Civi Renew Membership

This software runs from the command line and updates the Membership based on the past contributions.

I have a number of membership types that include the string "month" or "year" or "life" and I use these
strings to determine how long to extend the membership end date. The status is also updated to current,
grace or expired depending on the date.

This software won't work for other configurations without some modification but I hope it gives you 
some ideas what can be done. I may create an extension, based on this concept, that is run when a 
contribution is added.

Don't run this software unless you understand what it is doing. Make sure you backup before using 
any software like this.

I don't guarantee that the software is written the best way and it certainly is not quick.
